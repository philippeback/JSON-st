This is a Gnu Smalltalk port of Squeak JSON which is used for the SCouchDB 
driver (www.squeaksource.com/SCouchDB).

It uses Gitocello to track Squeak JSON in the squeakJson branch. I try to 
keep the code in Squeak mostly compatible. Gnu Smalltalk specific changes 
that cannot be easily incorporated into the Squeak package are in the master
branch.
